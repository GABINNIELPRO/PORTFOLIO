  At **SKF S2M**, operators working in electrical cabinets often spend a lot of time consulting documentation to operate equipment correctly, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. To solve this, we developed an **intelligent system combining RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Speech-to-Text, and augmented reality**. Operators can ask questions verbally, and the system retrieves and displays relevant instructions directly in an **Apple Vision Pro headset**, allowing hands-free access and increasing efficiency and safety.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

In industrial environments, operators often struggle to quickly access the right documentation while working on complex equipment. At **SKF S2M**, a company specialized in **magnetic bearings**, this challenge was particularly significant for those working in electrical cabinets. Traditional methods of consulting manuals were slow and error-prone.  

To address this, we developed an **intelligent system combining RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), speech recognition, and augmented reality**, creating a seamless and intuitive workflow for operators.

### System Concept

The concept is simple but powerful:  
- Operators **ask questions verbally** using **Speech-to-Text**.  
- The **RAG engine** searches vast datasets to retrieve the most relevant documentation and generates **contextualized, accurate responses**.  
- These instructions are then **displayed directly in an Apple Vision Pro headset**, allowing the operator to see step-by-step guidance **hands-free**, while staying focused on the task.

This approach transforms technical documentation into a **live, interactive assistant**, improving efficiency and safety on the shop floor.

### Technologies and Development

- **Python & Go**: Core logic for data processing, API integration, and high-performance backend operations.  
- **Ollama**: Efficient document retrieval and question-answering system.  
- **Azure AI**: Cloud infrastructure for scaling and managing large datasets.  
- **GPT-4**: Generates coherent, contextually relevant text from retrieved information.  
- **React**: Frontend interface for monitoring the system and interacting with queries.  
- **Apple Vision Pro**: Augmented reality headset for hands-free visualization of instructions.  
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment and scalability.

### Results and Impact

- Operators can access instructions **in real time**, directly in their field of view.  
- Significant reduction in time spent consulting documentation and fewer operational errors.  
- Immersive and interactive experience that **redefines technical documentation in industrial settings**.  
- The system achieved a **95% relevance score** for information retrieval and text generation.
