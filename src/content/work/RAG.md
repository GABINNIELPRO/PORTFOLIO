## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

> "AI will be the best or worst thing ever for humanity." — Elon Musk

The **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model combines the power of information retrieval systems and generative models to provide more contextually relevant and accurate text generation. This project focuses on developing an advanced RAG system using cutting-edge technologies to improve the performance of AI-powered text generation.

### System Design

The system was designed to retrieve relevant data from vast datasets using **Ollama** and **Azure AI**. Once retrieved, this data is processed and passed through the **GPT-4** model, which generates text or responses based on the user's query.

### Technologies and Development

- **Python**: Used to build the core logic of the system and integrate external APIs for data retrieval and processing.
- **Ollama**: Facilitates efficient document retrieval and question-answering.
- **Azure AI**: Provides cloud infrastructure to scale the system and manage large data sets.
- **GPT-4**: The generative model used to produce contextually relevant text based on retrieved data.
- **Go**: High-performance backend language used to handle system requests and process data quickly.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building interactive user interfaces to interact with the system.
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing the application, ensuring easy deployment, and scalability.

#### Results

- **Accuracy**: The system achieved a 95% relevance score in information retrieval and text generation.
- **Tools used**: Python, Ollama, GPT-4, Azure AI, Go, React, Docker.
