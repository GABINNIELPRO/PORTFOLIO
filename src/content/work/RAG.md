  At **SKF S2M**, operators working in electrical cabinets often spend a lot of time consulting documentation to operate equipment correctly, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. To solve this, we developed an **intelligent system combining RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Speech-to-Text, and augmented reality**. Operators can ask questions verbally, and the system retrieves and displays relevant instructions directly in an **Apple Vision Pro headset**, allowing hands-free access and increasing efficiency and safety.

## 🤖 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

In industrial environments, operators often struggle to quickly access the right documentation while working on complex equipment. At **SKF S2M**, a company specialized in **magnetic bearings**, this challenge was particularly significant for those working in electrical cabinets. Traditional methods of consulting manuals were slow and error-prone.  

To address this, we developed an **intelligent system combining RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), speech recognition, and augmented reality**, creating a seamless and intuitive workflow for operators.

### 🧠 System Concept

The concept is simple but powerful:  
- 🎤 Operators **ask questions verbally** using **Speech-to-Text**.  
- 🔍 The **RAG engine** retrieves the most relevant documentation and generates **contextualized and accurate responses**.  
- 👓 These instructions are then **displayed directly in an Apple Vision Pro headset**, allowing hands-free, real-time step-by-step guidance.

This transforms technical documentation into a **live, interactive assistant**, improving efficiency and safety on the shop floor.
